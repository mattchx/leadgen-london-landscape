## Current Task

### Objective
Add a new CTA section after the Services section to capture user interest when it's highest.

### Context
- Currently have CTAs in:
  - Hero section (Call Now button)
  - About section ("Get a Free Quote" button)
  - Main quote form section ("Request Your Free Quote" button)
  - Footer ("Get Quote" link)
- New CTA will be placed strategically after Services section
- Will maintain consistent design language with existing CTAs

### Implementation Plan
1. Create new section after Services section with:
   - Gradient background (from-nature-green to-leaf-green)
   - Compelling headline focused on taking action
   - Brief supporting text
   - Two prominent CTA buttons: one for phone call, one for form submission
   - Visual separation from surrounding sections

### Design Specifications
- Background: Gradient from nature-green to leaf-green (consistent with quote form section)
- Text: White for good contrast
- Buttons:
   - Phone CTA: White background with nature-green text (inverse of hero section button)
   - Form CTA: Nature-green background with white text (matching theme)
- Layout: Flex container for side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Spacing: py-12 for good vertical rhythm
- Responsive design maintaining mobile-first approach

### Next Steps
Task completed. The "5 Tips for a Beautiful Lawn" section has been replaced with a single hero image in `index.html`.
