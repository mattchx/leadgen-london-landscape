## Current Task

### Objective
Update the form section to focus on landscaping services with improved UI and more intuitive placeholders.

### Context
The form section has been updated to include:
- New landscaping-focused headlines and copy
- Intuitive placeholder text (e.g., "Your Name Here...")
- Project details field for capturing specific landscaping needs
- Professional UI elements with landscaping service focus
- 24-hour quote turnaround promise
- Maintained existing Submit-Form.com integration

### Next Steps
Task completed. The form now properly reflects the landscaping business focus with improved user experience and clear call-to-action. The headlines in the quote request form have been adjusted for better visual hierarchy, a gradient background has been added to the section, the secondary headline has been softened, and the "Get Your Free Quote" button text has been changed to "Request Your Quote".
