## Current Task

### Objective
Move the hero image from being a background image in the hero section to a standalone image section immediately following the hero section in `index.html`. This aligns with the project roadmap goal of improving clarity and visual hierarchy.

### Context
The current `index.html` has a hero section where the main call to action and text are overlaid on a background image. The user wants to separate the image to enhance the clarity of the primary content.

### Next Steps
Task completed.
