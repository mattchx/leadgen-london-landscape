### Data Flow

### Recent Significant Changes
-   **Image Section Relocation**: The hero image will be moved from a background element within the hero section to a separate, visible section immediately following the hero section. This aims to improve the clarity of the main CTA and text.
-   **Dual CTA Implementation**: The new CTA section after Services now offers both "Call Now" (white background, green text) and "Request a Quote via Form" (green background, white text) options, clearly differentiated visually and matching the theme.

### User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
